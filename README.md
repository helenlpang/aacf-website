Our project was created by using Javascript with the React library, through code edited in Visual Studio.

To run our code, open our ZIP file. Go to terminal and cd into the correct folder. Use terminal to execute npm (node packaging manager) arguments such as “npm install” to install all necessary node packages. Run “npm install” and then “npm start” to start localhost on your open port which will likely be 3000. 

This should take you to the homepage. Underneath the Welcome message in the center, there is a button that says "Interested...". If you click on this button this should take you to a separate page where you can join the fellowship. At the top, there is a navigation bar. At the top left, there is a logo of HRAACF (which is who the website is for). Clicking on this logo will always bring you back to this homepage. On the right side of the NavBar, the “Churches” tab brings you to a new webpage listing different churches around the Boston area. The “Members” tab takes you to a separate page that lists all the members that registered for AACF through the website. The “Photos” tab brings you to a page with a photo gallery of AACF. The “Join AACF!” tab brings you to the same page as the button underneath the Welcome Page. The “About Us” page goes into more detail about AACF.

The “Churches” tab has a search bar, which helps you filter out churches by name. For example, if you type "h" all the churches with “h” anywhere in its name will show up. Then if you add "hi", all the churches with “hi” will show up. If none of the queries match up to the church names, none of the churches will be displayed. Each church is a separate row with 4 different cells. The first cell is the church name, the second cell is the denomination, the third cell is the address, and the last cell is the service times. Below all the churches is a map with church icons that are over the location of each church. If you click on the church icon, the specific church that it is covering shows up along with the address.

If you click on the first three church names: Citylife, Aletheia, and Symphony, this should take you to three individual pages with further descriptions. We chose these 3 churches because this is where the AACF members attend church. The other church names link to their respective church’s websites. On the Citylife page, there is a quick description of what Citylife is like. Underneath the description is a link to the Citylife website. Below that are directions to get to Citylife as well as where the members usually meet to leave to go to church. Lastly, there is a table that lists the members of AACF who attend Citylife. Their names, email, church affiliation, and graduating class year is listed. This applies for both the Symphony and Aletheia pages.

The members page lists all the members and separates the years by freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Each member has a row with their name, email, church affiliation, and graduating year. 

The photos page is a collection of a few pictures from this semester of AACF. If you click on any of the photos, they enlarge and you can click to go through the gallery.

On the Join AACF! tab, you can register to be a part of the website as well as the fellowship. Insert your first name, last name, email, church, and your graduating class year. Click on the submit button and your name should be displayed in the members page.

The About Us tab brings you to a page with description about AACF as well as a group picture.
