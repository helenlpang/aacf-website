                    Welcome to the website for the Harvard-Radcliffe 
                    Asian-American Christian Fellowship (AACF)!

                <p>
                    The mission of AACF is to know God and make God known. 
                    Our desire is to be a voice of faith among the Asian 
                    community at Harvard. We aim to be a relational community 
                    that loves the campus with the love we have received from God. 
                    Along with our sister fellowships, Soul Food Fellowship and 
                    the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship, we seek to embody 
                    Intervarsity's core values and doctrinal basis.
